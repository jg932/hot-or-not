###Introduction


## To Use This Template

__Replace `<name-of-your-app-here>` in the commands below with the name of your app!__

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SEI-Remote/men-stack-oauth-template.git <name-of-your-app-here>
cd <name-of-your-app-here>
```

Once you are in the project directory:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

Here's what your command line output should like after this step (note that the indicator that we are in a git repository is gone!)
