- We have a database of hot peppers and their Scoville rating.  
- There is also a database of hotsauces.
- If you click on the name of each sauce you can view user reviews too.
- Anyone visitor can view the databases and reviews.
- Signing in via Google sets you up with a profile so you can add your own reviews, hotsauce entried and set your own personal spiciness preference so others know where you are coming from with your ratings!

To add any entries: hotsauces, peppers or reviews, you must be logged in. If you don't see these spaces to add, find the Google link on the right side of the nav bar on any page.

## Geneal Background Info

Spicy food is a love of mine.  This project has been an opportunity to combine my love of spicy with my love of organization!  Do most people need a database of hot sauces?  Probably not. But if you want to find the right sauce for a meal or recipe you don't have much opportunity to actually try a sauce. Suddenly you have a few bottles of not very good hot sauce with no easy way to use them up. 

But now there is a database! Help others, help yourself, enjoy spicy food!

One last piece of info, the Scoville Index! If you would like that background there are actually some interesting [articles](https://www.chilliworld.com/factfile/scoville-scale) about how a scale for spiciness evolved during the 18th and into the 19th century if you are up for it.  However, the basics are that the higher the Scoville Heat Units (SHU), the more capsaicin is present in the pepper, the spicier it is. 

## This Project Used
Trello! This project was planned on Trello.  The wireframes, ERD, user stories, planning and build schedule are there. You can visit the planning phase [here](https://trello.com/b/ISjTNvpC/unit-2-project). 

The site itself is built using:
- Mongoose and MongoDB
- Express
- Node
- and of course HTML,CSS,JS
- the fun font is used via personal use only license from Kong Font.
- the chili pepper animation used code via Furat's CodePen.

## Still to Come
Additional features I hope to add to Hot or Not in the future:
- Sorting hot sauces via spiciness.
- A list of pepper types used in each sauce in show view.
- Allowing guests to add minimal ratings.
- Expanding to include other spicy food categories. 
- Lots more pictures of the database entries!
